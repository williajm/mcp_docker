# Bandit security linter configuration
# https://bandit.readthedocs.io/

# Paths to exclude from scanning
exclude_dirs:
  - '/tests/'
  - '/.venv/'
  - '/build/'
  - '/dist/'

# Tests to skip (use test IDs from bandit -l)
# B101: assert_used - we use asserts in tests, which is fine
# B601: paramiko_calls - not applicable, we don't use paramiko
# B602: subprocess_popen_with_shell_equals_true - subprocess calls validated separately
skips:
  - B101

# Severity level to report (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH)
# Only report MEDIUM and HIGH severity issues
# Target specific tests for security-critical code:
# - B201: flask_debug_true
# - B301-B324: Pickle, marshal, shelve, etc. (deserialization vulnerabilities)
# - B401-B411: Import checks for insecure modules
# - B501-B509: Weak cryptography
# - B601-B612: Shell injection, SQL injection, etc.
