**Security Review – GPT‑5**

- High – `docker_create_container` accepts `volumes` mappings and forwards them directly to Docker without validating host paths (src/mcp_docker/tools/container_lifecycle_tools.py:166-215). Attackers with tool access can bind-mount `/etc`, `/var/run/docker.sock`, or the full host filesystem into containers, bypassing the intended safety controls. The project already ships `validate_mount_path` in src/mcp_docker/utils/safety.py but never uses it outside tests. Call `validate_mount_path` for every host path (optionally enforcing an allow-list from config) or block bind mounts unless explicitly enabled.
- Medium – The `generate_compose` prompt dumps container environment variables verbatim into the LLM context (src/mcp_docker/prompts/templates.py:432-476). Environment blocks often contain secrets (DB passwords, API tokens, etc.), so invoking this prompt with a remote model leaks credentials. Redact values (show only keys or counts), add a confirmation gate, or document the disclosure risk prominently.
- Medium – SECURITY.md tells users to run `./start-mcp-docker-httpstream.sh` / `./start-mcp-docker-sse.sh` “with security features” for production, yet both scripts force `SECURITY_OAUTH_ENABLED=false` and omit IP allowlists (start-mcp-docker-httpstream.sh:1-90, start-mcp-docker-sse.sh:40-74). Following the guide leaves an unauthenticated HTTPS endpoint that grants root-level Docker control to anyone who can reach it. Either enable OAuth/IP restrictions by default in the scripts or update the documentation to prevent a false sense of security.

Strengths: rate limiting, audit logging, TLS/DNS‑rebinding safeguards, operation safety classifications, command sanitization, and OAuth/JWKS validation are well-integrated. Residual risk remains configuration heavy—review defaults, ensure prompts prevent data exfiltration, and add automated tests around any new mount-validation logic.
