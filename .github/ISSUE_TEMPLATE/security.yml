        ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Private Disclosure Recommended

        For security vulnerabilities, we strongly recommend using **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting**:

        1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/williajm/mcp_docker/security)
        2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
        3. Fill out the private advisory form

        This keeps the vulnerability private until a fix is released.

        If you choose to report publicly below, please **DO NOT** include:
        - Exploit code
        - Detailed steps that could be weaponized
        - Information that could harm users before a fix is available

        See our [Security Policy](https://github.com/williajm/mcp_docker/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more details.
